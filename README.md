# ðŸ“¦ Practice With Data Structures

This repository is a collection of small coding exercises focusing on the fundamentals of data structures like Arrays, LinkedLists, and TreeSets. Assigned as part of my coursework, these exercises helped me strengthen my understanding of how these structures work and how they can be applied in future projects.

While it's just a single file of guided practice, it demonstrates my ability to write clean, organized code and showcases my grasp of the key principles behind these data structures.
